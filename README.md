# Disclaimer

I do realize that right now the structure of modules does not make much sense as the whole app loads all modules at start anyways, but well...
The same goes to a lot of stuff in the app, but the scope of the app wouldn't allow me to show almost anything i was asked to show in the 3rd 
page of the assignment if i did only what is neccesary.
